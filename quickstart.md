SubNotify is a plugin that can direct messages to system popups instead of having to resort to Sublime message dialogs  
or status bar messages.  SubNotify works in Windows, Linux, and Mac.

In order to get started, there is some setup.  Follow the links below:

- Windows
    - [Native Windows popups](http://facelessuser.github.io/SubNotify/usage/#windows-taskbar-notifications).
- Linux
    - [Ubuntu OSD popups](http://facelessuser.github.io/SubNotify/usage/#ubuntu-osd)
- Mac
    - [Notification Center](http://facelessuser.github.io/SubNotify/usage/#mac-notification-center).

When you are all setup, you can run the test command to see your popup.  The test command is found in the menu:  
`Preferences->Package Settings->SubNotify->Test SubNotify`.
